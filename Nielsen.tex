\subsection{Andrew Nielsen}

I'm working towards getting my Masters degree in Cybersecurity. My goal for this course is to be able to prepare for my PhD down the road and be able to apply the research knowledge I gain from this class herein. I'm hoping to learn how to read efficiently and quickly navigate through research documents. I'm looking to be able to understand how to research and how to narrow down a topic that will help in the future. I'm studying cyber security in the master's program. 

The research area that I have been working on is ransomware with fuzzy techniques in geo-spatial systems. Part of it has been in understanding ransomware, fuzzing, and identifying gaps in geo-spatial research extending past the earth's atmosphere.

Some code that I found on GitHub that deals with ransomware was found \href{https://github.com/mauri870/ransomware.git}{here}. This code actually simulates how ransomware behaves and encrypts all the files on a machine and stores the encryption key on a remote server so the user is not able to decrypt their files.
